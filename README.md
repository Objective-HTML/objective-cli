# 👩‍💻 Objective HTML CLI
> This is the CLI version that allows you to transpile and execute Objective code.

## How to install

To install Objective CLI, you have to execute that command in a terminal:

```properties
npm i objective-cli -g
```

Once it's installed, you can start using Objective.

## Basic commands

First, the most important command is :

```properties
objective compile <file>.html
```

That will create a Javascript file with the transpiled code.

You can also watch the directory with `--watch` argument.

```properties
objective compile <file>.html --watch
```
